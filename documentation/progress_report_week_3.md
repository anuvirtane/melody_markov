# Week3 progress report

I added testing documentation file. After discussion with teacher I decided to make melody instead of just using chords, and start with using notes of the same length for a start (not considering rhythm). I googled ABC notes that could be used as a base. I decided to make a script that downloads them based on key (so that I don't have to do it manually). 
Time spent: 1 h

I ended up using files with multiple abc notes in single file instead (and not make a script for downloading).
Time spent: 2 h

Use parser library for parsing abc notes. It gives key and notes in a way that can be inserted into Trie. Experiment to find out if the way that notes come out of the parser can be played with pygame - yes, they can.
