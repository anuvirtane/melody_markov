# Week3 progress report

I added testing documentation file. After discussion with teacher I decided to make melody instead of just using chords, and start with using notes of the same length for a start (not considering rhythm). I googled ABC notes that could be used as a base. I decided to make a script that downloads them based on key (so that I don't have to do it manually).
