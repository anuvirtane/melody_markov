# Week 6 progress report

Implement small changes suggested in feedback. Make peer review for week 5.
Time spent: 1 h

Pygame plays _previous_ melody and not the one generated now. Spend time trying to use midi2audio (to no avail) instead, and by adding sleep to make pygame wait. It does not wait. So always the melody played is not the one generated now, but the previous one.
Time spent 1,5 h.
