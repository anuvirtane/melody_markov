# Week 2 progress report

I read through the description and played with a Markov chain example given here: https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/markov-chains-python-tutorial and then tried out PyDTMC library. Started figuring out how to transform the sound in wav file to something Markov Chain understands and ended up using aubio library. I played with it.
Time spent this far: 3,5 h

I found out I should use Trie data structure, so I did some reading on it.
Time spent: 1 h

Experiment with converting ABC notation to MID file and playing MID file with pygame.
Time spent: 1 h

I made a simple Trie. Then I spent more time digging into the possibility of getting input through the microphone and saving it in wav file but it did get difficult. I went back to ABC notation plan.
Time spent: 2,5 h

Play with the simple Trie. Make unit tests for it. Add test coverage and pylint.
Time spent: 2 h

Time spent in total: 10 h
