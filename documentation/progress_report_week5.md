# Week 5 progress report

Add implementation report with structure of project and estimates of time and space complexities. Fix some note parsing issues. Start Markov chain implementation. Seems like I will have to implement a function in the Trie that returns probability of a certain note after wanted notes instead of the list of whole melodies that it is returning now.
Time spent: 2,5 h

Make peer review.
Time spent: 1 h

Make Trie return dictionaries that contain followers of note sequences of wanted length (state).
