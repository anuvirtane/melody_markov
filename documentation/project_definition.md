# Project definition

The aim of this project is to implement an application that uses Markov chain algorithm to generate melodies.

No

## Algorithms and data structures

Markov chain algorithm, data structures not clear yet

## Motivation for algorithm chosen

Markov chain "decides" what state to go to next, after having been at a specific state. It uses probabilities to do this, and has many use cases. It can generate "creative" output, and I am interested in seeing how "creative" it can get with music

## Input and output

Input will be a melody given in ABC notation. Output will be a melody played. Program gets the beginning of a melody as input and returns a full melody, that is the beginning of what it got, and what it generated to continue the melody. This output will be a sound file.
